<h1>Website for Helloheni</h1>

<h2>Info</h2>
The company I created a website for is helloheni; they have their own products, started on Etsy, and now want to expand by having their own website and advertising their products on their website instead of Etsy. The company wanted a website that would help them expand their business and allow them to sell the products for which I provided photos in the brief. To create this website, I built a base page in HTML, adding a menu bar to help with navigation for users, images, and general text information on the page. Then, using CSS, I changed the colors for each individual section of the page to orange and black. The overall look of the page was refined using CSS. Finally, to make the page have functions and interactions, I used JavaScript to create functions such as the ability to click all buttons and elements on the page, to take users to the linked page with that button, as well as to perform functions such as purchasing by clicking the cart.

The website is compatible with other devices, such as phones and tablets. When using a phone, everything is aligned with the interface using the following: "meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1".
